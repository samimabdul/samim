DESCRIPTION
Read the following description and extend the functionality through inheritance and polymorphism (Maintenance).
Inherit two classes Savings Account and Current Account from Account class. 
class Account {
  double balance;
  boolean withdraw(double bal){
    this.balance = this.balance - bal;
    return true;
  }
}
Implement the following in the respective classes:
SavingsAccount 
Add a variable called minimum Balance and assign final modifier.
Assume minBalance = 500.
Override method called withdraw (This method should check for minimum balance, allow withdraw to happen and returns a boolean value accordingly).
CurrentAccount
Add a variable called overdraft Limit.
Assume OverDraftLimit = -2000.
Override method called withdraw (checks whether overdraft limit is reached, allow withdraw to happen and returns a boolean value accordingly).


code




class Account
{
    double balance;
        boolean withdraw(double bal)
        {
            this.balance=this.balance-bal;
            return true;
        }        

    }    
class SavingAccount extends Account
{
    SavingAccount(int b)
    {
        this.balance=b;
    }
    final int minBalance=500;
    boolean withdraw(double bal)
    {
        if(this.balance-bal>=minBalance)
        {
            this.balance=this.balance-bal;
            return true;
        }
        else 
        return false;
    }
}
class CurrentAccount extends Account
{
    CurrentAccount(int b)
    {
        this.balance=b;
    }
    int overDraftLimit=-2000;
    boolean withdraw(double bal)
    {
        if(this.balance-bal>=overDraftLimit)
        {
            this.balance=this.balance-bal;
            return true;
            
        }
        else
        return false;
    }
}
